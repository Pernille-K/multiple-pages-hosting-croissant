    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant (French pronunciation: [kʁwasɑ̃]) is a buttery, flaky,
      viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but
      using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for
      their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled
      and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in
      a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
      texture, similar to a puff pastry.
